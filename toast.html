      <h3>Coronavirus LIVE Updates: India's Death Toll Rises to 1,223 as Positive Cases Near 38,000-mark</h3>
      <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/2FCD/production/_111973221_gettyimages-1210641942-594x594.jpg" target="_self" alt="sem exams students">
      <p>Coronavirus LIVE Updates: The central government today said the death toll due to the novel coronavirus in India has risen to 1,223 and the number of positive cases has increased to 37,776. This number includes 26,535 active cases and 10,018 patients who have been cured/discharged/migrated.

        The Tamil Nadu government today said it will not allow any relaxations in containment zones across the state during the third phase of the lockdown from May 4. Standalone shops in non-containment zones, except hair salons and beauty parlours, can function from 11 am to 5 pm, while shops selling essential commodities will function between 6 am to 5 pm. Restaurants can function from 6 am to 9 pm but only with takeaway services.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a series of meetings with key ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and officials of economic ministries to firm up the second stimulus package for sectors impacted by lockdown to curb spread of coronavirus, sources said.

            The prime minister held discussions with Shah and Sitharaman and would have follow up meetings with ministers of key economic ministries such as Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), sources said. The finance ministry, which deferred release of monthly GST collection numbers on Friday, is also scheduled to make a detailed presentation to the prime minister later in the day on the state of economy and several initiatives that it plans to undertake to stimulate Indian economy.
            
            As many as 41 people from one building in Theke Wali Gali near the District Commissioner's office in Kapashera, south west Delhi, have tested psoitive for coronavirus. The building was sealed on April 19 after one person from the building was diagnosed with the virus.</p>
            <p>A school in Rajkot district in Gujarat reopened and asked students to attend classes today despite the nationwide lockdown. Videos showed students at the Pardi Swami Vivekananda School despite the education departmentâ€™s orders to keep the school closed.

                As citizens gear up for easing of curbs with the phase-3 of the lockdown from May 4, the total number of novel coronavirus cases in the country has increased to 37,336 while the death toll has increased to 1218, according to health ministry data. The rise of 2,293 case is the biggest single-day jump while the number of deaths increased by 71 in the last 24 hours.
                
                India be under lockdown till May 17 with a complete ban on air travel, trains and inter-state road transport for the general public while educational institutions, theatres, malls, hotels and bars will also remain shut, the government announced on Friday. However, it gave some relaxations for various business activities and people's movement within areas with limited or no COVID-19 cases identified as orange and green zones. Some economic activities will also be allowed in red zones, but high-restrictions will continue in the containment zones within them.
                
                The coronavirus death toll in the United States climbed by 1,883 in the past 24 hours, a tally by Johns Hopkins University showed Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to nearly 65,000.</p>
                <p>he Baltimore-based university had recorded more than 1.1 million cases in the country as of 8:30 pm Friday (0030 GMT Saturday), with 64,789 deaths, a rise of three percent from a day earlier. The US has by far the highest death toll of any country in the global pandemic.

                    Globally, 3,400,278 people have been infected by coronavirus so far, and the total number of deaths from the disease stands at 239,570. Nations hit with most coronavirus cases at present are the US (1,131,030 ) Spain (242,988), Italy (207,428), UK (177,454), France (167,346) and Germany (164,077).
                    
                    In India, the number of cases have crossed the 35,000-mark, while the number of deaths stand at over 1,150. All major urban centres, including Delhi and Mumbai, have been identified as 'red zones' or areas with large numbers of cases -- hence not many relaxations would be applicable to them beyond the already permitted ones for those involved in essential services.
                    
                    Outside the containment zone falling within red zones, certain more activities will be prohibited and these include plying of cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws, running of taxis and cab aggregators, intra-district and inter district plying of buses, as also barber shops, spas and saloons.
                    
                    Special trains also began operating on Friday, which also happened to be Labour Day, to help lakhs of migrant workers stranded for over a month at various urban centres.</p>
