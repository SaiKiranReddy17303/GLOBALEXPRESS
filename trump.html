        <p>New Delhi: The US President Donald Trump has accused the World Health Organisation (WHO) of being a public relations agency for China. According to a report by PTI, Trump said on Thursday that the World Health Organization should be "ashamed of" itself and that the organsiation is acting as a public relations agency for China.</p>
        <p>The Trump administration has also launched a probe to look at the role of WHO in the coronavirus pandemic and has suspended financial assistance to it.</p>
        <p>"I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they are like the public relations agency for China," Trump told reporters in the East Room of the White House.</p>
        <p>The reports say that although he did not hold the President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping responsible for the pandemic he said that a lot more could have done to stop the pandemic.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to say that, I don't want to say that, but certainly it could have been stopped. It came out of China and it could have been stopped and I wish they had stopped it and so does the whole world wish they had stopped it."</p>
        <h5>Coronavirus oroiginated in China's lab, says Trump</h5>
        <p>Trump was also confident about his allegations that the virus originated in a virology laboratory in Wuhan, China. According to the report, he said, "Yes, I have. Yes, I have," when reporters at the East Room of the White House asked if he has seen anything that gives him confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is where the virus originated. When asked what made him confident about the accusation he said, â€œcan't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that."</p>
        <p>Trump refused to divulge any details but said that investigations will be started soon.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged the WHO failed to deliver and misled the world on coronavirus. "The World Health Organization simply failed to respond in this case," he told Scott Sands of The Scott Sands Show in an interview.</p>
        <p>The US President also talked about the financial support given to WHO and said that The United States pays almost USD500 million a year while China pays USD38 million a year. "Whether it's a lot more, it doesn't matter. They shouldn't be making excuses when people make horrible mistakes, especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die."</p>
        <p>The United States is has become the global epicentre for the pandemic. According to Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, the total confirmed cases has reached 1,069,424.</p>
